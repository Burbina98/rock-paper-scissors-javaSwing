# A game of Rock Paer Scissors 🕹️
A simple game of rock paper scissors designed in pure java.
I wanted to challenge myself by creating a game while only using java which is why I impemented Swing instead of JavaFX. 
It is a simple one-click round design, that plays against a computer that is randomized in its decision making. 

## Features 
- One Player gameplay
- Win detection with visual feedback
- Score tracking
- Simple layout making the UI easy to manipulate and not overcomplicated.

## What I learned 🧠
- Adding action listners to Java Swing components.
- Using object oriented programming to develop a graphical interface and handle user input.
- Applying game logic to java components

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- Java
- JavaSwing

## Challenges 
- Issues with trying to access data elements from different classes.
- Learning about different swing methods to customize graphics.
- Dealing with the lack of customization that comes with an older tech like swing.

## Possible futer improvements 📌
- Make more visually pleasing and push the boudaries of swing.
- Try to add some animation for a more rewarding victory.
